# axoloti-preenfm2

Nothing to see here, carry on.

Well actually I got Axoloti to work well on the PreenFM2 but it included some nasty hardware hacking and a new, proper DAC chip plugged onto the P405 board, all of which is why I won't release any further info on this project. Not to mention the Axoloti patch needed to actually interface with the LCD and knobs.

Be happy with your stock axoloti and/or stock PreenFM2 and don't waste time on this hack.
