# Eurorack PCB eagle files for the preenfm2

Here is the first revision Eagle files for the Eurorack daughter board.
This board converts Modulation inputs (cv3 and CV4) -5V to +5V for Preen AIN
It handles V/Oct 0-8V from CV2 to AIN and Gate from CV1 to AIN.

All the unnamed diodes are general purpose diodes.
Shotky diodes are also what ever fits. As long it has very low forward voltage.

CV inputs can be wired straight to 3.5mm jacks.
Same with MIDI and USB.

+5V needs to be routed to the mainboard.
